# My Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio repository! This repository showcases my skills and projects in Python, particularly in the areas of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and FastAPI. Below you will find an overview of the projects and examples that demonstrate my expertise.

## Projects

### 1. AI Projects

#### [Project 1: Neural Network for Image Classification](https://github.com/)
- **Description**: Developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.
- **Technologies**: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Highlights**:
  - Implemented data preprocessing and augmentation techniques.
  - Achieved an accuracy of 90% on the test dataset.
  - Utilized GPU acceleration for faster training.

#### [Project 2: Natural Language Processing with Transformers](https://github.com/)
- **Description**: Built a text classification model using BERT to analyze sentiment from movie reviews.
- **Technologies**: Python, Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch, Pandas
- **Highlights**:
  - Fine-tuned a pre-trained BERT model on a custom dataset.
  - Implemented tokenization and data pipeline for efficient processing.
  - Achieved a high F1 score on the validation set.

### 2. FastAPI Projects

#### [Project 3: RESTful API for Machine Learning Model Deployment](https://github.com/)
- **Description**: Created a FastAPI application to serve a machine learning model for real-time predictions.
- **Technologies**: Python, FastAPI, Uvicorn, Pydantic, Scikit-learn
- **Highlights**:
  - Developed endpoints for prediction, model training, and health checks.
  - Implemented input validation and error handling with Pydantic.
  - Deployed the API using Docker and orchestrated with Kubernetes.

#### [Project 4: Microservices Architecture with FastAPI](https://github.com/)
- **Description**: Designed and implemented a microservices architecture using FastAPI for a scalable web application.
